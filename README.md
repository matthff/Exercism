# Exercism Solutions

Welcome to my solutions repository for [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/) – a platform for practicing and improving programming skills through hands-on coding exercises in various languages.

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises across different tracks (languages) on Exercism. Each folder is organized by language, and within each language, exercises are categorized by their respective names.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each exercise folder typically includes:
- `README.md`: Description of the exercise (provided by Exercism)
- `*.ext`: My solution file(s), where `ext` matches the language (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.rs`)
- `test.*`: The test file used to validate the solution (when included)

> **Note**: Some test files may be modified to experiment or improve readability, especially while learning.

## 🚀 Goals

- Practice and improve proficiency in multiple programming languages
- Learn idiomatic patterns and best practices
- Track my learning journey over time

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup

- [Exercism CLI](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally)
- Code editor of choice (e.g., Neovim)
- Language-specific tooling (e.g., Python, Node.js, Rust)
- Mise-in-place for using specific versions, so some folders might have mise.toml files for configuration

## 📌 Notes

- These solutions are **personal** and not meant as model answers. 
- If you're solving the same exercises, try to complete them yourself before looking at others’ code.
- I often refactor or revisit past exercises as I improve.

## 🧠 Learning in Progress

I’m constantly working through new exercises and revisiting old ones. Contributions are not accepted (as this is a personal repo), but feel free to explore and get inspired!
